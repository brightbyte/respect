RESPECT is a simple tool that ensures that boundaries are respected.
It doesn't care what the boundaries are, or what thy are for.

The idea of RESPECT is that there are items, and groups of items, and 
connections between items. And there are rules about items of which
group may be connected to items of which other group. Each item and
each group is represented by an arbitrary name.

It operates on three graphs represented as adjecancy lists:
- the //connection// graph defines which item is connected to which
  other item.
- the //membership// graph defines which group each items belongs to.
- the //rule// graph defines if members of one group are allowed to be
  connected to another group.
